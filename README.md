# CurrentCost Custom Component for Home Assistant

**Please note: Home Assistant 2021.12 or higher is required for this custom component to work**

This repo is a custom component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

The `currentcost` sensor platform is using the data provided by a [CurrentCost](http://www.currentcost.com/) device connected to the serial port via a [data cable](http://www.currentcost.com/product-datacable.html).

The sensor returns the Total Power (usually on Appliance 0) as a state, and the temperature as an attribute.
It is also possible to list additional appliances by listing the appliance number that CurrentCost devices are paired with

Confirmed working devices:
- Currentcost Envi (aka CC128)
- Currentcost EnviR

## HACS Installation

The easiest way to install this custom component is via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
1) Follow the [installation instructions](https://hacs.xyz/docs/installation/prerequisites) to install HACS
2) Click on the HACS icon in the left side bar, click on the elipsis on the right handside and select `Custom Repositories`
3) enter `https://github.com/lolouk44/CurrentCost_HA_CC` in the URL box, select `Integration` as a category


## Manual Installation
To install the CurrentCost custom component:
1) Create a folder called `custom_components` in your config folder (same folder where configuration.yaml is locate, if that folder does not already exist)
2) Create a folder called `currentcost` (no spaces, lowercase)
3) Copy the files inside the [CurrentCost_HA_CC](https://github.com/lolouk44/CurrentCost_HA_CC/tree/master/custom_components/CurrentCost_HA_CC) folder into the `currentcost` folder


## Configuration

To setup a CurrentCost sensor to your installation:
1) Add the following code to your `configuration.yaml` file under the existing `sensor` and `template` headers. (do not copy/paste the `sensor` or `template` headers). 
If `sensor` or `template` do not already exist, add the code block including the `sensor` or `template` header.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

### serial_port:
**description**: Local serial port where the sensor is connected and access is granted.  
**required**: true  
**type**: string  
note: when using HA in a docker environment, make sure you assign a name to the device when mounting it, e.g. `--device=/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0` as opposed to just `--device=/dev/ttyUSB0`
### name:
**description**: Friendly name to use for the frontend. Default to "Current Cost".  
**required**: false  
**type**: string  
### baudrate:
**description**: Baudrate of the serial port. 57600 is the value needed for EnviR devices.  
**required**: false  
**default**: 57600 Bps  
**type**: integer  
### devices:
**description**: List of appliance numbers paired with a CurrentCost sensor  
**required**: false  
**default**: 0  
**type**: integer
